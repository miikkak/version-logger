## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please follow these steps if you discover a security vulnerability in this project:

### Do Not

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

### Do

1. **Report privately** via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/miikkak/version-logger/security/advisories/new) <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD013 -->
2. **Include in your report:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)

3. **Response timeline:**
   - You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
   - We'll provide a detailed response within 7 days
   - We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
   - We'll release a fix as soon as possible

## Scope

This plugin logs each player's username, UUID, and client protocol version to the proxy's own log
output. It doesn't open any network listeners of its own, doesn't read credentials, and doesn't
execute anything derived from untrusted input - its attack surface is limited to whatever
Velocity itself exposes to plugins. If you find a way this plugin could be used to affect the
proxy or other plugins beyond its documented behavior, that's exactly the kind of thing to
report.

## Security Best Practices

When using this plugin in production:

- Always use a specific released version, not a locally built `SNAPSHOT` jar, in production
- Usernames and UUIDs are already public within the game itself; this plugin only adds them to
  your own server logs, so treat your log retention/access the same way you already treat other
  server logs
- Keep the plugin updated - check releases periodically or watch the repository

## Security Scanning

This project uses automated security scanning:

- **Trivy** (filesystem scan against `gradle.lockfile`) for dependency vulnerability scanning,
  on a weekly schedule and on demand
- **Renovate** for automated dependency updates

## Other Automated Review

Every pull request also gets an AI code review. This is a general correctness/quality review,
not a vulnerability scanner - don't rely on it as a substitute for the security scanning above.

## Disclosure Policy

- Security issues are fixed in private before public disclosure
- After a fix is released, we publish a security advisory
- We credit reporters in the advisory (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Past Security Advisories

No security advisories have been published yet.

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please use the reporting method above rather than
public channels.
